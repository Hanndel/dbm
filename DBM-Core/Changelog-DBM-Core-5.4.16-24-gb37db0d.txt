	- nbluewiz via svn r11397: # koKR update.
	- Omega via svn r11395: somehow, people's bombardment counts are getting out of sync, which really shouldn't be possible unless bad syncing is going with variables. without sufficient data and only speculation to go on, just adding an extra reset in on phase 4 start for extra measure.

	- Omega via svn r11365: Convert several warnings to taunt type, enable by default. Enable any PERSONAL warnings for all by default too, it's already filtered by the fact that the only person who gets them is person affected by it. basically, any Stack or You warning should be enabled by default regardless of spec, if it's a personal warning.
	- Omega via svn r11362: Add option to control the global tank filter
	- Omega via svn r11349: Untested blocker for taunt warnings when not tank spec.

	- Omega via svn r11345: actually just do this
	- Omega via svn r11344: Allow arc warnings for melee even if they join in late. It's safe to assume that if melee are targeting boss1 or boss2, they are probably attacking/in range of it.
	- Omega via svn r11343: increment alpha
